# part-of-speech-tagger
A part-of-speech tagger for Catalan which uses Hidden Markov Model to tag tokenized untagged text (Python) 

# Overview
The training data is provided tokenized and tagged; the test data will be provided tokenized, and your tagger will add the tags. 

# Notes
## Slash character. 
The slash character ‘/’ is the separator between words and tags, but it also appears within words in the text, so be very careful when separating words from tags. All tags in the data are exactly two characters long.
